#Program 2: Guess the number
#Generate 1 random number (0-100)
#Ask the user to guess the number
#Display “Greater than” if the inputed number is greater than the random number
#Display “Less than” if the inputed number is less than the random number
#Repeat asking the user until the random number has been guessed correctly.
